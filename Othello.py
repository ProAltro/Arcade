Not a Valid Move!

Input Rules:
1. Each move played HAS to "out-flank" at least one of the opponent's discs.
   i.e. At least one of the opponent's disc has to get flipped
2. A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends by discs of the opposite color.
3. A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
4. All the discs which are outflanked, i.e. surrounded by opposite colors at each end of the row, will be flipped.
